# Flask URL Shortener

This oneâ€™s simple on purpose. It takes a long URL, gives you back a short one, and redirects it. Thatâ€™s it.

I built it to practice web fundamentals: routing, form handling, HTTP methods, and templates â€” without hiding behind a bunch of frameworks or JavaScript. Just Flask, logic, and clean design.

### ðŸ§  What It Teaches

- How GET and POST requests actually work
- How to handle and validate forms without a library
- Clean URL routing and redirect logic
- Reusable HTML templates with Jinja
- Light UI decisions that still feel good to use

Simple interface. Clear purpose. No distractions.

### ðŸ§© Why This Matters

I wanted to stay close to the logic. Get a better feel for the data flow and the little things that make a basic app usable. I focused on clarity â€” in both the code and the UI. This was about fluency, not flash.
